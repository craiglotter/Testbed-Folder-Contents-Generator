Testbed-Folder-Contents-Generator
=================================

Testbed Folder Contents Generator is useful for quickly generating medium complex file and folder hierarchies for the purpose of application development testing. By selecting the maximum depth, maximum amount, file terms as well as file extensions, the application can quickly generate a large number of valid test text-based files and folders.
